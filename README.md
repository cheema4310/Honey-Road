# Honey Road — Restaurant Website Redesign (Concept)

Redesign concept for **Honey Road Restaurant** (Burlington, VT).  
Built as a modern, cleaner alternative to the existing website while keeping the same core content structure (reservations, contact, hours, location, team, gift cards).

- **Live Demo:** https://honeyroad.vercel.app/
- **Original Website (reference):** https://www.honeyroadrestaurant.com/
- **Repo:** https://github.com/cheema4310/Honey-Road

---

## Project Background

This project was initially scaffolded using **Google AI Studio (Gemini) / “vibe coding”** to speed up the first draft.  
After that, I manually refined the implementation, including:

- layout + spacing tweaks
- image `src` fixes / replacements
- copy + information corrections
- general UI polishing for a cleaner restaurant landing page

---

## What’s Included (UI Sections)

Typical restaurant site sections such as:

- Hero / intro
- Reservations call-to-action
- Hours + location
- Contact info
- Team section
- Gift cards section
- Footer / navigation

> Note: Exact section names and component structure may differ in code, but the goal is a complete restaurant landing page experience.
